✅ Answer:
I gathered the latest news and insights regarding India's future economic growth prospects. Here's a summary of the key developments:

1. **ICICI Prudential Quality Fund Launch**:
   - The ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has introduced a new fund focusing on investing in companies with strong fundamentals, such as high return on equity and robust cash flows. This move highlights the emphasis on quality investments amidst economic uncertainties, indicating a strategic approach towards stabilizing growth.

2. **World Bank Report on Income Equality**:
   - A recent report from the World Bank shows that India ranks among the leading nations in income equality, with a Gini Index score of 25.5. This improvement reflects the effectiveness of various government welfare schemes and policy reforms aimed at reducing poverty. The focus on inclusive development is crucial for sustaining long-term growth.

3. **Economic Growth Forecast**:
   - India's Chief Economic Advisor has conveyed optimism about innovation-led and inclusive growth despite global challenges. However, S&P Global Ratings has slightly downgraded India's growth forecast for the current financial year to 6.3%, pointing to market uncertainties. Key areas of focus include energy affordability, employment, education, and manufacturing, emphasizing the necessity for continued structural reforms.

### Conclusion
India is actively pursuing avenues for future growth through quality investments and inclusive policies. However, external factors and market uncertainties may pose challenges, necessitating ongoing reforms to ensure sustainable economic expansion.
